# Passenger-Transportation-Analysis
This classification problem predicts whether a passenger will be successfully transported during interplanetary travel based on personal and travel attributes.

# üöÄ Passenger Transportation Classification Challenge

## Project Overview
This repository contains my solution to an assessment project aimed at predicting whether a passenger will be successfully transported during interplanetary travel based on personal and travel attributes. The project was completed for the **Galactic Transportation Initiative (GTI)**, focusing on optimizing passenger safety and travel efficiency.

## üìÑ Problem Statement
The goal is to predict passengers' `Transported` status (TRUE/FALSE) using classification models. The dataset includes various features such as passenger attributes (`Age`, `VIP` status), spending patterns, cabin information, and travel details. The challenge involves:
1. Comparing classification models and selecting the best one based on metrics like AUC-ROC.
2. Adjusting thresholds for specific scenarios where False Negatives (FN) and False Positives (FP) have varying costs.

## üìã Objectives

### Part A: Initial Model Comparison and Hyperparameter Tuning
1. Compare two baseline classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Optimize the models using `RandomizedSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation (`cv=5`), tuning two hyperparameters for each model.
3. Evaluate optimized models using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - AUC-ROC
4. Plot ROC-AUC curves for visualization and comparison.
5. Select the best model (`best_model`) based on performance metrics.

### Part B: Error Analysis and Threshold Selection
1. Use the `best_model` from Part A to analyze and adjust thresholds for two scenarios:
   - **Scenario 1**: Balanced approach minimizing both FN and FP.
   - **Scenario 2**: Prioritizing recall to minimize FN, even at the cost of higher FP.
2. Document the thresholds chosen for each scenario and the trade-offs encountered.
